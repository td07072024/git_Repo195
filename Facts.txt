The Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), Javan rhino, Sunda rhinoceros or lesser one-horned rhinoceros is a critically endangered member of the genus Rhinoceros, of the rhinoceros family Rhinocerotidae, and one of the five remaining extant rhinoceros species in South Asia and Africa. It has a plate-like skin with protective folds and is one of the smallest rhinoceros species with a body length of 3.1–3.2 m (10–10 ft) and a 1.4–1.7 m (4 ft 7 in – 5 ft 7 in) long tail. The heaviest specimens weigh around 2,300 kg (5,100 lb). Its horn is usually shorter than 25 cm (9.8 in).

Up until the mid-19th to about the early 20th century, the Javan rhinoceros had ranged beyond the islands of Java and Sumatra and onto the mainland of Southeast Asia and Indochina, northwest into East India, Bhutan, and the south of China. Today, it is the rarest of all rhinoceros, and among the rarest of all living animal species, with only one currently known wild population, and no individuals successfully kept in captivity. It is among the rarest large mammals in the world with a population of approximately 74 rhinos within Ujung Kulon National Park, at the far western tip of Java, Indonesia.
